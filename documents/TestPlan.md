TEST PLAN

# Introduction
## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to improve our abilities of reading other people’s code. We also hope to learn new testing strategies and how to document them. 
Another objective is to get exposed to the Open Source projects and learn the process of how to contribute to them properly and in the best way possible.

## Research
We did not find any github issues or github PRs related to our assigned section of code.

## Planned Tests
1. check if the variable ‘cal’ gets an empty pandas DataFrame, in other words, check if the variable 'cal' is not receiving proper data.
2. check if the code properly handles when the variable ‘cal’ gets a pandas DataFrame that contains only NaNs.

## Risks

## Test Approach
Read and understand the code assigned to us, and develop tests that address the functionality of the code block. No automation.

## Test Environment
A new server is required for the web server, the application and the database.
